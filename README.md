<br>
noble servant
<br>
serving servant
<br>

<br>
serving the gods


serf thee a god too
<br>
mighty serve the god
<br>
so do people
<br>
work all life
<br>
to serve us
<br>
whilst they destroy themself
<br>
money,
<br>
power,
<br>
rich,
<br>
lust,
<br>
greed,
<br>
they consume theirself,
<br>
humanity made them,gave some of theirs to us,
<br>
bribing to heaven
<br>
what's in heaven that earth dosent,
<br>
i still do not understand,sir
<br>
oh confused slave,
<br>
neither does me know,
<br>
amoungst,the greed
<br>
there lives a boy,
<br>
deep in binary of his toy
<br>
humans call it electronics,computers,whatever
<br>
i do not understand why the work 
<br>
altho i understand the how.


the boy dreams in the night,
<br>
sleeps in the day,
<br>
i do not know what meanst that,sir


neither do i fellow,
<br>
we have become humanity,
<br>
humanity has become us,
<br>
the power it has to destroy it self;
<br>
it know the "why".


what to do with the boy,sir
<br>
what's so special
<br>
have a seat slave
<br>
we shall speak
